# Manual ifft generation using fft
comparing manual IFFT implementation using FFT with MATLAB's built-in IFFT function.

Both methods yield accurate reconstructions.
MATLAB's built-in IFFT function demonstrates superior performance in execution time.
Built-in IFFT proves to be the more efficient choice for practical signal processing tasks.

Looking forward to discussing further.
